				As we go through any class, we learn a lot but do not remember all of it. This website details the specifics of our biology class and summarizes what we've learned.

				Animal cells are similar and different from plant cells in multiple ways. Both animal cells and plant are eukaryotic cells, meaning that they both contain their genetic information within a seperaate membrane, called the nucleus. Thy also both preform cellular resiration inside their <a href="mitochondia.html">mitochondria</a>
